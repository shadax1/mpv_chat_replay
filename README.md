# mpv_chat_replay
Python script that replays a livestream chat alongside a local video playing in [mpv](https://mpv.io/).

**Note:** At the moment, this script only works with chat logs from HexChat where lines are formatted as follows:

`MMM DD hh:mm:ss <username> message`

- `MMM` being a short month name (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc...)
- `DD` being a day of month (01-31)
- `hh` being hours (00-24)
- `mm` being minutes (00-59)
- `ss` being seconds (00-59)

This script has been tested on both Windows 10 and Linux (Mint distro, based on Debian and Ubuntu)

## Requirements
This script relies on a couple things:
+ mpv player
+ Python 3 (this was developed with version 3.9.7 but anything above should work fine)
+ The `mpv` python package which can be installed with `pip install mpv`
+ `ffprobe` which can be installed by downloading the release binaries/executables [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) or with a package manager like [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or apt. Type `ffprobe` in a command line to see if the command is present or not
+ `mpv-1.dll` (for Windows users) which is included in this repository but can also be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/mpv-dev-x86_64-20210801-git-416668d.7z/download)
+ The video file to play needs be named exactly the same way OBS does by default (example: `2017-03-10_22-57-54.mp4`)
+ A log file generated by HexChat
+ The year when logging started for the given log file

## How to use
Download this repository and unzip it anywhere on your disk. Open a command line in the unzipped folder and type:
```bash
python mpv_chat_replay.py #or python3 mpv_chat_replay.py
```
You will be prompted to enter the path to the video to play, the chat log file to scan alongside the video and the year when logging started for that log file.
mpv will then start and the command line will display chat lines as the video plays or as you scrub through it.
